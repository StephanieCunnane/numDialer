They've written the API that simulates making phones calls. It consists of ONE endpoint:
     POST /call
        our body:
           {
               "phone": string,
               "webhookURL": string  (we provide, points to our backend)
           }
        they return:
            {
                "id": 2345
            }

As the call simulation progresses, their API sends updates to our webhook URL. Example format:
    they send us a POST, body is:
      { "id": 2345, "status": "answered" },

Our frontend uses XHR polling to know about the calling status updates

Their API is running on port 4830


Frontend spec:
   a list of all numbers and their current statuses
   one CALL button - click once to kick everything off, then disable
   WebSockets

Our backend spec:
   route for making calls with their API
       
   route that handles webhook notifications (webhookURL is "localhost:3001")
   route to display the React app

We're always dialing 3 numbers at a time till the pool is used up
Go straight down the given list
No DB 


- React is too much
- Node http module to set up a server


Web sockets:
  init:
   const socket = new WebSocket("wss://localhost:3001");
